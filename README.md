After given this data, my immediate question was to see how these stars would correlate with the HR diagram. After plotting the stars on a graph of Luminosity (L/Lo) vs Temperature (K), I noticed that they do not appear to be similar at all. In fact the data seemed erratic, without any clear trends.
