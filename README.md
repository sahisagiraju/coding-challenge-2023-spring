I was initially curious to see how many of each stars were available. Nevertheless, we must go back to the task.

After given this data, my immediate question was to see how these stars would correlate with the HR diagram. After plotting the stars on a graph of Luminosity (L/Lo) vs Temperature (K), I noticed that they do not appear to be similar at all. In fact the data seemed erratic, without any clear trends.
